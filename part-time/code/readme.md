# Running the project

Note that this is a combined frontend / backend project. The frontend is implemented in Angular, and the backend is implemented using a simple JSON server. The project is set up to run both the frontend and the backend at the same time.

In order to run the project you need to do the following:

```
npm install
```

This will install the needed scripts for the project. Note: If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can use the built-in terminal to run the command. The terminal can be opened using the `Ctrl + ~` keyboard shortcut. Note that this command only needs to be run once - and this command will take some time to complete.

```
npm start
```

This will start the project. The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:4200/` and the backend will be available at `http://localhost:2999/`. The frontend will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
